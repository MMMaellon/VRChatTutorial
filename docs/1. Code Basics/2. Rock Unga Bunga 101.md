# Rock Unga Bunga

You may think that Rock Unga Bunga is just binary, but that's not exactly true. Ones and zeroes are a level of ==_abstraction_==. The true language of the rocks is "conducts electricity" and "doesn't conduct electricity" which is not nearly as catchy.

!!! Notice
	The following is a massive simplication

Computers are made of semiconductors which are materials that conduct electricity... *"semi"* of the time. The electrons in silicon are usually locked in place because they're being used to form bonds between atoms, but if you introduce impurities like phosphorus or boron into your chips, you get an instability that allows electrons to hop from one atom to another.

We can also influence the conductivity of our material by using a nearby charge to disturb the balance of electrons in our semiconductor like in the gif below:

These properties of semiconductors allow us to make ==*n-type transistors*== which will only conduct electricity when a charge is applied, and ==*p-type transistors*== which will only conduct electricity when no charge is applied.

In other words, we can turn conductivity on and we can turn it off again at will.
