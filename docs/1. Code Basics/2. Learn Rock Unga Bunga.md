!!! Notice
	The following is a massive simplication of how transistors work. There's a lot I'm leaving out.

Rock language is not made up of words and sounds (see video above), it is made up of electricity and the lack of electricity, AKA ones and zeroes.

Computers are made of semiconductors which are materials that conduct electricity... *"semi"* of the time. The electrons in silicon are usually locked in place because they're being used to form bonds between atoms, but if you introduce impurities like phosphorus or boron into your chips, you get an instability that allows some electrons to hop from one atom to another.

Another way to change the conductivity is disturbing the balance of electrons with a nearby charge like in this animation of a ==*transistor*==:

We can make ==*n-type*== transistors which will only conduct electricity when a charge is applied, as well as ==*p-type*== transistors which will only conduct electricity when no charge is applied.
