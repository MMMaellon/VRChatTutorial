# Step 2: Learn Rock Unga Bunga

!!! Notice
	The following is a massive simplication of how transistors work

You may think that Rock Unga Bunga is just binary, but that's not exactly true. Ones and zeroes are a level of ==_abstraction_==. The true language of the rocks is "conducts electricity" and "doesn't conduct electricity". Not nearly as catchy.

Computers are made of semiconductors which are materials that conduct electricity... *"semi"* of the time. The electrons in silicon are usually locked in place because they're being used to form bonds between atoms, but if you introduce impurities like phosphorus or boron into your chips, you get an instability that allows some electrons to hop from one atom to another.

Another way to change the conductivity is disturbing the balance of electrons with a nearby charge like in this animation of a ==*transistor*==:

We can make ==*n-type*== transistors which will only conduct electricity when a charge is applied, as well as ==*p-type*== transistors which will only conduct electricity when no charge is applied.

Whether or not a current is flowing on one piece of wire
