# Part 1 - Gates

!!! Notice
	The following is a simplication. It's not 100% accurate and skips over details.

Your computer is made up of semiconductors which conduct electricity... *semi* of the time. Electrons can flow through the material, but only if there's an instability that allows them to flow through. For example, silicon uses 4 valence electrons to form its crystals. Adding boron impurities, which only have 3 valence electrons, creates a _hole_ that sucks in nearby electrons. The spot where the electron used to be becomes another hole and the process repeats, allowing for a current.

You can influence the concentration of electrons and holes -- and therefore the conductivity of a semiconductor -- by applying a charge to something nearby like in the animation below:

Don't worry if none of this makes sense to you. The important thing to remember is that a charge on the top part allows the bottom part to conduct electricity. This thing we've created is often called a _gate_ which is a perfect way of thinking about it.
