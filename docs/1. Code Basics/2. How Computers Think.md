# How Computers Think

A computer's most basic component is called a ==transistor== and it's made of semiconductors -- materials that conduct electricity *"semi"* of the time.

We can change a semiconductor's conductivity at will by applying a voltage to a nearby piece of metal. You don't need to understand the specifics of how this works, just know that some science is happening to allow transistors to control the flow of electricity on a wire like valves controlling the flow of water through a pipe.

In the above animation, the transistor is "opened" when we apply a voltage to it. We can also make one that "closes" when a voltage is applied and combine the two in different ways to make simple logic circuits.

We can make a circuit that adds two numbers, and we can make another circuit that subtracts two numbers, and then we can use the example above to make a combined circuit that toggles which one of the first two circuits is active.

If we combine enough circuits, we'll eventually end up with a CPU can do every basic task from arithmetic, to flashing the RGB lights in your CPU case.
