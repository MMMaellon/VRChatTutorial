# How Computers Think

!!! Notice
	The following is a massive simplication of how transistors work. There's a lot I'm leaving out.

Computers are made of semiconductors which are materials that conduct electricity *"semi"* of the time. The electrons in silicon chips are usually locked in place because they're being used to form bonds between atoms, but if you introduce impurities like phosphorus or boron, you get an instability that allows some electrons to hop from one atom to another. The instability is a result of phosphorus having one more valence electron than silicon and boron has one less.

We can also influence the concentration of electrons with nearby electric fields to either increase or decrease the conductivity of a material as seen in this animation:

The result is that we can make some materials naturally conductive and some materials naturally non-conductive and have them switch when an electric field is applied.

???+ More Info
	In modern transistors, the electric field is created by applying a small voltage to the gate terminal which just a nearby piece of metal. A thin insulating layer prevents current from flowing from the gate to the rest of the transistor.
