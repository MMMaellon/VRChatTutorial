# How Computers Think

A computer's most basic component is called a ==transistor== and it's made of semiconductors -- materials that conduct electricity *"semi"* of the time. We can change a semiconductor's conductivity at will by applying a voltage to a nearby piece of metal. If electric current running through a wire was like water running through a pipe, then transistors would be the valves that control which pipes the water can flow through. Except the valves are opened and closed without any moving parts.

You don't need to understand the specifics, just know that some science is happening to make transistors.

In the above animation, the "gate" is "opened" when we apply a voltage to it. We can also make a gate that "closes" when a voltage is applied and combine the two to make simple logic gates.

Binary is a way of representing numbers using only ones and zeroes. The numbers 0 - 3 in binary would look like this:

| Decimal number | Binary number |
| -------------- | --------------|
| 0 | 00 |
| 1 | 01 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 11 |

The reason why computers use binary is because it's easy to translate into circuits.
