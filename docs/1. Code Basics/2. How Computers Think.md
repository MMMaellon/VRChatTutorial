# How Computers Think

A computer's most basic component is called a ==transistor== and it's made of semiconductors -- materials that conduct electricity *"semi"* of the time. We can change a semiconductor's conductivity at will by applying a voltage to a nearby piece of metal. You don't need to understand the specifics, just know that some science is happening which rearranges the electrons in a semiconductor and changes its properties as shown in this gif:

In the above animation, the "gate" is "opened" when we apply a voltage to it, allowing current through without needing an physical moving parts. We can also make a gate that "closes" when a voltage is applied and combine the two to make simple logic gates.
