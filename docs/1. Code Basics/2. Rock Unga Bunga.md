A computer's most basic component is called a [==transistor==](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) which is made of semiconductors -- materials that conduct electricity *"semi"* of the time. You don't need to understand the specifics of how they work, just that we can use transistors to control the flow of electricity through a wire like a valve controls the flow of water through a pipe.

In the above example, the transistor only allows current when there is a voltage applied to the gate terminal, but we can also make transistors that only allow current when there is no voltage.

In this gif, I've combined both types of transistors
