## Transistors

A computer's most basic component is called a [==transistor==](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) which is made of semiconductors -- materials that conduct electricity *"semi"* of the time. You don't need to understand the specifics of how they work, just that we can use transistors to control the flow of electricity through a wire like a valve controls the flow of water through a pipe.

The above gif shows a valve that "opens" when voltage is applied, but we can also make valves that "close" when voltage is applied. Together, these gates can make simple circuits like this:

## Machine Instructions

Modern computers automatically perform something called the Von Neumann cycle which works like this:
1. Read a preset number of 1's and 0's into the CPU from the program counter
2. Move the program counter to the next line of 1's and 0's

The program counter is just an address that points to where our next machine instruction is.
