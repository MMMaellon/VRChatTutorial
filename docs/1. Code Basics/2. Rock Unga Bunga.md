## Part 1 - Gates

Your computer is made up of semiconductors which conduct electricity... *semi* of the time. Electrons can flow through the material, but only if there's an instability that allows them to flow through. For example, silicon uses 4 valence electrons to form its crystals. Adding boron impurities, which only have 3 valence electrons, creates a _hole_ that sucks in nearby electrons. The spot where the electron used to be becomes another hole and the process repeats, allowing for a current.

You can influence the concentration of electrons and holes -- and therefore the conductivity of a semiconductor -- by applying a charge to something nearby like in the animation below:

If we attach 3 wires to this thing, we've created a transistor, also known as a _gate_.

## Part 2 - Ones and Zeroes

We can attach 3 wires to our gate like this:
