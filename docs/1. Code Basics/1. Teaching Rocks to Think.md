## Computers are dumb as rocks.

This is factually true. Your PC is made of silicon, copper, and rare earth metals that were mined from the ground and, though it can accomplish very seemingly-intelligent tasks, we have to remember that it is a rock and it is as dumb as a rock.

This is important because _**Humans are smarter than rocks!**_

Programming is just the dumbing down of human-level thought to rock-level unga bunga. That doesn't mean that programming is easy, but it does mean that it is more akin to playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html) than it is 5D chess. You might suck at both QWOP and 5D chess today, but QWOP can be  learned through trial and error and mashing buttons -- which is actually how I learned to write code.

## How do rocks think

!!! Notice
	The following is a simplication. It's not 100% accurate and skips over details.

Your computer is made up of semiconductors which conduct electricity... *semi* of the time. Electrons can flow through the material, but only if they're not being used to form bonds with the atoms around it. Silicon has 4 valence electrons and uses all of them. Adding phosphorus impurities, which have 5 valence electrons, adds an extra unused electron that's free to roam around and conduct a current.

When you have too few electrons you create ""

To fix this, we can use a nearby electromagnetic force to move electrons around like in the diagram below:
