## Computers are dumb as rocks.

This is factually true. Your PC is made of silicon, copper, and rare earth metals that were mined from the ground and, though it can accomplish very seemingly-intelligent tasks, we have to remember that it is dumb as a rock because it is a rock.

This has two major implications:
1. We taught rocks to think
2. We can make complex systems from rocks
