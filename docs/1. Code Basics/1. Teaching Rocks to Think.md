## Computers are dumb as rocks.

This is factually true. Your PC is made of silicon, copper, and rare earth metals that were mined from the ground and, though it can accomplish very seemingly-intelligent tasks, we have to remember that it is dumb as a rock because it is a rock.

This is important because **Humans are smarter than rocks!** -- That's right, even you!

Programming is just the dumbing down of human-level thought to rock-level ones and zeroes.
