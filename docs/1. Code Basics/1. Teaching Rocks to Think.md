## Computers are dumb as rocks.

This is factually true. Your PC is made of silicon, copper, and rare earth metals that were mined from the ground and, though it can accomplish very seemingly-intelligent tasks, we have to remember that it is a rock and it is as dumb as a rock.

This is important because _**Humans are smarter than rocks!**_

Programming is just the dumbing down of human-level thought to rock-level unga bunga. That doesn't mean that programming is easy, but it does mean that it is more akin to playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html) than it is 5D chess. You might suck at both QWOP and 5D chess today, but QWOP can be  learned through trial and error and mashing buttons -- which is actually how I learned to write code.

## How do rocks think

Your computer is made up of semiconductors which conduct electricity... *semi* of the time. The material only conducts electricity when the concentration of electrons in the material is right. Silicon comes with 4 valence electrons and makes up most semiconductors. If we mix in phosphorus impurities our 

We can also affect the concentration of electrons with electromagnetic forces. The below animation, electrons are trying to flow from left to right, but can't until we apply a charge to something nearby which pulls some electrons up, making room for other electrons to pass through on the bottom half.
