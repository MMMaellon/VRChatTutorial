## Computers are dumb as rocks.

This is factually true. Your PC is made of silicon, copper, and rare earth metals that were mined from the ground and, though it can accomplish very seemingly-intelligent tasks, we have to remember that it is a rock and it is as dumb as a rock.

This is important because _**Humans are smarter than rocks!**_

Programming is just the dumbing down of human-level thought to rock-level unga bunga. Now, this doesn't mean that programming is easy, but it does mean that it is more like playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html) than it is 5D chess.

## How do rocks think

Your computer is made up of semiconductors -- usually made from silicon -- which conduct electricity... semi of the time. Electrons will only flow if the concentration of electrons in the material is right. For example, if we add phosphorus as an impurity to our silicon, we'll have extra electrons because phosphorus comes with 5 valence electrons compared of silicon's 4.

We can also affect the concentration of electrons with electromagnetic forces. The below animation, electrons are trying to flow from left to right, but can't until we apply a charge to something nearby which pulls some electrons up, making room for other electrons to pass through on the bottom half.
