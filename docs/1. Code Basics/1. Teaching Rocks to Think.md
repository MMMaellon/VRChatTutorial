## Computers are dumb as rocks.

This is factually true. Your PC is made of silicon, copper, and rare earth metals that were mined from the ground and, though it can accomplish very seemingly-intelligent tasks, we have to remember that it is a rock and it is as dumb as a rock.

This is important because _**Humans are smarter than rocks!**_

Programming is just the dumbing down of human-level thought to rock-level unga bunga. That doesn't mean that programming is easy, but it does mean that it is more akin to playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html) than it is 5D chess. You might suck at both QWOP and 5D chess today, but QWOP can be  learned through trial and error and mashing buttons -- which is actually how I learned to write code.

## How do rocks think

### Part 1: Gates

!!! Notice
	The following is a simplication. It's not 100% accurate and skips over details.

Your computer is made up of semiconductors which conduct electricity... *semi* of the time. Electrons can flow through the material, but only if there's an instability that allows them to flow through. For example, silicon uses 4 valence electrons to form its crystals. Adding boron impurities, which only have 3 valence electrons, creates a _hole_ that sucks in nearby electrons. The spot where the electron used to be becomes another hole and the process repeats, allowing for a current.

You can influence the concentration of electrons and holes -- and therefore the conductivity of a semiconductor -- by applying a charge to something nearby like in the animation below:

Don't worry if none of this makes sense to you. The important thing to remember is that a charge on the top part allows the bottom part to conduct electricity. This thing we've created is often called a _gate_ which is a perfect way of thinking about it.
