# Step 1: Believe in yourself

The first step in learning how to code is believing that you can code. There's a common misconception that writing code is like playing 5D chess because computers are so complex, but that's not true.

Your CPU is composed of silicon, copper, and other minerals dug out of the ground. It is literally dumb as a rock and can only process ones and zeroes. You, on the other hand, are a complicated organism with thoughts, feelings, and, most importantly, the ability to understand the number 2!

Computers are simple. The real reason programming is hard is because humans are so complex that when we try to program computers it feels like playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html).

QWOP is a game where you try to make an Olympic runner run 100 meters. However, there is no "run forward" command. Instead, you have to tell the runner how to move the individual muscle groups in their legs. The difficulty comes from breaking down the already simple act of running into even simpler pieces because that's the only way the runner will understand what to do.

Programming is just like that. We are dumbing down high-level human thought to low-level rock unga bunga. For example, look at the following word:
```

With that in mind, let's go learn some rock unga bunga:
