# Step 1: Believe in yourself

The first step in learning how to code is believing that you can code.

Your CPU is composed of silicon, copper, and other minerals we dug out of the ground. It is literally dumb as a rock and can only understand ones and zeroes. You, on the other hand, are a complex and sophisticated being who has thoughts, feelings, and, most importantly, knowledge of the number 2! You **ARE** smarter than a computer.

Programming is just the dumbing down of high-level human thought to low-level rock unga bunga. People often think that programming is like playing 5D chess, but in reality, it's more like playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html)

QWOP is a very simple game with a simple goal of running 100 meters, but it's still difficult because you can't just tell your guy to "run 100 meters" or even just "run". He is dumb as rocks and only understands "QWOP". 

However, this is a hurdle that's surmountable with some trial and error
