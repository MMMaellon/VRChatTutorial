# Step 1: Believe in yourself

The first step in learning how to code is believing that you can code. There's a common misconception that writing code is like playing 5D chess because computers are so complex, but that's not true. It's a lot more like playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html).

QWOP is a game where you try to make an Olympic runner run 100 meters. It seems easy, however, the runner doesn't seem to understand the concept of running, or walking, or crawling. Instead, you have to tell the him how to move the individual muscle groups in his legs to get him across the finish line. The difficulty comes from trying to break the already simple act of running into even simpler steps. Coding is very similar.

Just like the runner from QWOP, your computer is as dumb as a rock. It's literally composed of silicon, copper, and other minerals dug out of the ground and only able to process ones and zeroes. In contrast, your brain is incredibly smart, capable of processing thoughts, feelings, and most importantly, the number 2!

The true reason programming is hard is because humans are so complex that we need to dumb down human-level thought to rock-level unga bunga. And the more complicated a task is, the harder this process becomes. Fortunately for us, VRChat scripts tend to be especially simple, and only require a little dedication and practice to master.
