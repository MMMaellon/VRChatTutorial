# Step 1: Believe in yourself

The first step in learning how to code is believing that you can code.

Your CPU is composed of silicon, copper, and other minerals we dug out of the ground. It is literally dumb as a rock and can only understand ones and zeroes. You, on the other hand, are a complex and sophisticated being who has thoughts, feelings, and, most importantly, knowledge of the number 2! You **ARE** smarter than a computer.

Programming is just the dumbing down of high-level human thought to low-level rock unga bunga. People often think that programming is like playing 5D chess, but in reality, it's more like playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html)

QWOP is a very simple game with a simple goal of running 100 meters. However, you might find that you still suck at it. The problem is, you can't just tell your guy to "run 100 meters" or even just "run" because it turns out the guy is also dumb as rocks and only understands "QWOP". You are forced to translate your high-level goal into low-level instructions he can understand. 

Computers only speak in ones and zeroes which is somehow even lower level than QWOP, but fortunately the operating systems, game engines, and SDKs we use can help make bridging the gap a lot easier.
