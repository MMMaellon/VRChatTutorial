# Step 1: Believe in yourself

The first step in learning how to code is believing that you can code.

Your CPU is composed of silicon, copper, and other minerals we dug out of the ground. It is literally dumb as a rock and can only process ones and zeroes. You, on the other hand, are a complex and sophisticated organism with thoughts, feelings, and, most importantly, the ability to understand the number 2!

There's a common misconception that code is hard to write because computers are so complex and human brains are too simple, but, in reality, the reverse is true. Programming is not like playing 5D chess, it's like playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html).

QWOP is a game where you try to make an Olympic runner run 100 meters. However, there is no "run forward" command. Instead, you have to tell the runner how to move the individual muscle groups in their legs. The difficulty comes from breaking down the already simple act of running into even simpler pieces because that's the only way the runner will understand what to do.

Programming is just like that. We are dumbing down high-level human thought to low-level rock-for-brains unga bunga.

With that in mind, let's go learn some rock unga bunga:
