# Step 1: Believe in yourself

The first step in learning how to code is believing that you can code. There's a common misconception that writing code is like playing 5D chess because computers are so complex, but that's not true. It's a lot more like playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html).

QWOP is a game where you try to make an Olympic runner run 100 meters. It seems easy, however, the runner doesn't understand the concept of running, or walking, or crawling. He just doesn't know how to coordinate his legs so you got to do it for him.

Similarly, your computer is also as dumb as a rock. Partially because it's literally composed of silicon and other minerals, but also because it can only process ones and zeroes. In contrast, your brain is capable of processing thoughts, feelings, and even the number 2!

Programming is just dumbing down human-level thought to rock-level unga bunga. This is especially true when writing scripts for VRChat where you don't need to know advanced algorithms or data structures. All it takes is a little practice in speaking rock unga bunga.
