The first step to learning how to code is to believe that you are capable of writing code. 

This is factually true. Though your PC can accomplish seemingly intelligent tasks, we have to remember that it is made from silicon, copper, and minerals mined from the earth and is therefore literally as dumb as a rock.

This is important because it means that _**Humans are smarter than rocks!**_

Programming is just the dumbing down of human-level thought to rock-level unga bunga. That doesn't mean that programming is easy, but it does mean that it is more akin to playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html) than it is 5D chess. You might suck at both QWOP and 5D chess today, but QWOP can be  learned through trial and error and mashing buttons -- which is actually how I learned to write code.

With that in mind, let's start by learning how rocks think:
