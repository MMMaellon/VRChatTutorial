# Intro

This tutorial aims build a foundation strong enough to make simple VRChat worlds. There's a lot to learn when it comes to programming, but we'll just focus on the basics needed for VRChat. These are things like:
- Basic code structure
- Syncing
- Improving FPS

## No coding experience is needed.

I'm going to split the tutorial into 3 sections, and while I recommend reading it all in order, feel free to pick and choose what sections you want to read.

!!! Note
    I might also get around to recording a video tutorial that covers the same topics for those with short attention spans.
