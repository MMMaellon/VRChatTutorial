# Coding for VRChat 101

> by MMMaellon

This tutorial aims build a foundation strong enough to make simple VRChat worlds. There's a lot to learn when it comes to programming, but we'll just focus on the basics needed for VRChat. These are things like:
- Basic code structure
- Syncing
- Improving FPS

!!! Note
    I might also get around to recording a video tutorial that covers the same topic for those with short attention spans.

# Code Block Test

	```
