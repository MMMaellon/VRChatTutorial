# Intro

This tutorial explains how to program VRChat games for beginners who have literally never written a line of code before.

## No coding experience required!

I will be doing my best to explain every concept from the ground up without being boring by *only* focusing on the bare minimum needed to work on VRChat worlds.
I recommend reading each section in order, but feel free to skip around and progress at your own pace.

    I might also get around to recording a video tutorial that covers the same topics for those with short attention spans.
