# Intro

This tutorial explains how to program VRChat games for beginners who have literally never written a line of code before.

## No coding experience required!

I will be doing my best to explain every concept from the ground up while focusing only on the essentials needed to work on VRChat worlds.

I recommend reading each section in order, but feel free to skip around and progress at your own pace.
