# 1.3 How does programming relate to VRChat

Most programmers write code instead of just raw 1's and 0's. Some of them do write binary, but you shouldn't associate with them, they're crazy.

Code is converted into 1's and 0's later. In our case, VRChat has an interpretter that turns our Udon code into binary instructions for our computer.
