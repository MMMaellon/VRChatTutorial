# What are computers?

> Answer: They're rocks that think!

A lot of people treat CPUs like complex magical objects with minds of their own, but that's not true and it's a dangerous mindset to have if you want to understand how they work. They're just little blocks of silicon, an element that makes up most rocks and minerals. I.E. they're rocks.

# If computers are just rocks, why do they do stuff when connected to an electrical circuit?

To answer this, we're going to have a quick science lesson. This is easily the most complicated part of this entire tutorial, but it'll give a better foundation for how everything else works.

Most rocks are not great conductors and pure silicon also does a poor job of conducting electricity. However, silicon is actually classified as a *semiconductor* which means it can change its conductivity under the right conditions.

> *Semi*conductors conduct electricity *semi* of the time.\*
> \*Not grammatically correct, but totally makes sense if you think about it.

There are two ways to change silicon's conductivity:
1. By mixing in impurities.
2. By exposing it to a nearby electrical charge, such as a piece of metal with a current on it.

The first one is pretty obvious. Adding other elements will change how the material behaves. These mixtures get names like *p-type* or *n-type* silicon and some are less conductive than pure silicon and some are more.

The second method is less intuitive, but that's okay. We don't have to understand how it works. Just know that it works and it can affect conductivity in both directions.

Check out this gif. It shows a piece of silicon that was mixed to be naturally less conductive. But, by applying a charge to the gate, which is just a piece of metal, it becomes more conductive.

This little piece of silicon is called a **transistor**. Some people call them **gates** because they "open" and "close" to control the flow of electricity.

When you turn on your PC, electricity flows through through the input section of the little pins on the bottom of your CPU.

Different input pins will open and close different gates, which will result in the current taking a different path through the CPU to light up a different pattern of output pins. Modern CPUs have thousands of input and output pins which means there's no real limit to the number of different patterns they can make.
# Step 1: Believe in yourself

The first step in learning how to code is believing that you can code. There's a common misconception that writing code is like playing 5D chess because computers are so complex, but that's not true. It's a lot more like playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html).

QWOP is a game where you try to make an Olympic runner run 100 meters. It seems easy, however, the runner doesn't understand the concept of running, or walking, or crawling. He just doesn't know how to coordinate his legs so you got to do it for him.

Similarly, your computer is also as dumb as a rock. Partially because it's literally composed of silicon and other minerals, but also because it can only process ones and zeroes. In contrast, your brain is capable of processing thoughts, feelings, and even the number 2!

Programming is just dumbing down human-level thought to rock-level unga bunga. This is especially true when writing scripts for VRChat where you don't need to know advanced algorithms or data structures. All it takes is a little practice in speaking rock unga bunga.
